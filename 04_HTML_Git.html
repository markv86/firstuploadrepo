    <p>Hello, My name is Mark Virostek. I was born in Ohio and moved to Indiana after Highschool. I grew a large family as I worked in the electric utility business. Moved back to Ohio 8 years ago and became an electrician. Along the way we have brought 7 children into the world. After my wife passed away this summer, I hope this career will allow me to stay home with my kids for a few years.

        I really enjoy working with my hands; construction, remodeling, and repairing anything. This is a big change for me. Wish me luck!!!
